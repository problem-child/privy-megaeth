Behaviour seems to change based on:

    Disable confirmation modals (react-auth only)
    Turn off the default UIs that prompt the user to review before sending transactions and signing messages

rawTransactionContract successfully signs with confirms enabled
If disabled, the gas settings are messed up during signing
